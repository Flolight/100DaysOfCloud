# [AWS] Sagemaker #3 - Welcome to the Real World !

## Introduction

It is time to have some real-world inspiration and exam sample.

## Cloud Research

My main resource for this today topic has been [AWS Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/aws)

* Watch some episodes of AWS Hour Power about machine learning

  * Ben Snivly showing some architecture to analyse some tweet dataset in order to find some trends about company public image

* I spent some time on [AWS exam readiness free training](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=42183)

This is very good material when you start to have good confidence in your knowledge for the exam. There is a test at the end which covers the whole exam in 45 questions. This way, you will know where your last pain points are and try a sample exam (time management...)
